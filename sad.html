							Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide, if you're ever gonna, let me know (yeah)<br>
Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh<br>
I'm sad i know, yeah<br>

God gave her everything<br>
She took my heart and left me lonely<br>
I've been broken, heart's contentious<br>
I won't fix, I'd rather weep<br>
I'm lost and I'm found, but<br>
It's torture being in love<br>
I love when you're around<br>
But I fucking hate when you leave<br><br>
